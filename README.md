# tictactoe

level one javafx application, which is easy to learn. very simple app which demonstrates the working of javafx with multiple 
tictactoe methods. extensive use of imageViews. any suggestions is much appreciated.

## installation prequisites
1. openjdk, hopefully version 11
2. maven, for goodness knows, and add it to your path
3. optional, use vscode with complete java extensions.

git clone https://github.com/ardubluesky/tictactoe
```

step 2:

```
mvn clean javafx:run
```

step 3:

```
learn, all of the files have comments which will guide you properly and help a lot
```

packaging has been difficult for me as jdks have started to pull out javafx, hence i will try to put a zip file in the releases.


# But why this project?
this project was made of out a necessity. as high school students start to learn about java, gui is an important feature. there aren't many java guis other than javafx and swing, and there aren't many good tutorials to start out with the basics. hence i created this project, albeit a game to bring some interest into javafx so that it can reawaken again.

some sources you can use to learn javafx:
1. the bases: https://openjfx.io/openjfx-docs/
2. scence builder(very helpful in fxml, the layout and front end of the entire project): https://gluonhq.com/products/scene-builder/
3. stackoverflow(if you have never head of it, its a great place to ask questions and get coding answers. high chances are that its already done by experienced coders): https://stackoverflow.com/

# incase of errors:
1. if you are using vscode, do ctrl+shift+p, and select the option clean and reload

2. if on windows, head on to your user profile, go to appdata and clear your C:\Users\<username here>\AppData\Local\Temp folder
3. if any other errors pop out, i can't help cause i have never dealt with them, try stack overflow as mentioned
